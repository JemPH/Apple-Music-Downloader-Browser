## Features

## Installation
   Install the [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JemPH/Apple-Music-Downloader-Browser/main/apple-music-downloader.user.js) in your userscript manager. The script requires subscription in order to download files.

## Usage
  Just activate and install the script in Tampermonkey. The script should automatically run (as shown in the image preview above). Refresh the page if it doesn't work.

### Usage of `media-user-token`
To operate effectively, our extension requires access to certain resources on `music.apple.com`. Specifically, we use the `media-user-token` to authenticate and interact with Apple Music's web interface. Hereâ€™s how we handle it:

- **Purpose:** The `media-user-token` is used solely to facilitate the download of media content from Apple Music and is necessary for the functionality of the extension.
- **Scope:** We only access the `media-user-token` on `music.apple.com` and do not use it for any other purpose or share it with third parties.
- **Security:** We take precautions to ensure that the `media-user-token` is handled securely and is never exposed or misused.

## Code Obfuscation
### Why is the Code Obfuscated?
The source code in this repository has been obfuscated to:
- **Prevent Unauthorized Modifications:** Maintain the integrity of the code and prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Preserve Competitive Advantage:** Keep certain implementation details confidential.
- **Respect for API Limits:** Avoiding abuse of interactions with our API backend server to ensure that usage remains within limits and does not cause undue strain on the servers.

## Contact Us
If you have any questions, concerns, or need further clarification about the obfuscated code or any other aspect of the project, please contact me [here](https://t.me/JemPH). I am here to help and provide any additional information you may need.
